# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Funky Snake
*WIP*

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

a standard game of snake, except when the snake eats an 'apple' the snake grows a random length rather than a constant

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will be done in Python utilizing PyGame in order to remake the classic snake game. After doing so I will edit the base snake game to have custom visuals and implement a feature in which when the snake eats the 'apple' the snake grows abnormally and unpredictably. This adds a new level of difficulty, luck, and replayability factor which will seperate my rendition of Snake from the plethera of version of the game which exist. I am aiming to incorporate creative commons packages in order to make my snake game look better and smoother than classic blocks. Depending on visual selection, the Title may undergo changes

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

basic snake game functions

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

snake game with the randomized growth tweak

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

snake game with randomized growth tweak, maybe different difficulties and more detailed graphical interface

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to expand my python abilities, learn how to use pygame and learn how to assign controls in a pygame game.
