Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have recreated a very basic rendition of the classic Snake Game 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not attempted to add any specialized graphics or interface elements, nor have I implemented the randomized size increasement.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Recreating snake utilizing PyGame ended up being a lot tougher and requiring a lot of time trying to make sure it works as intended. This being said I am fairly confident in my ability to alter the foundation I have in order to make the growth of the snake randomized. My ambition about having quirky fun graphics is still blurry on how i would go about this, and my ultimate ambition to have an interface/main menu that the user could choose between playing different difficulties of 'Snake', one being the base snake rendition, one being the randomized growth version and perhaps another with more extreme multipliers in order to make an 'Impossible' difficulty, where the snake's range of random numbers to pick from would be higher such as 50-100 instead of 5-10 or something.
